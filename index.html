        <p> A rainbow is a meteorological phenomenon that is caused by reflection,<br>
         refraction and dispersion of light in water droplets resulting in a spectrum of light appearing in the sky.<br>
        It takes the form of a multicoloured circular arc.<br>
        Rainbows caused by sunlight always appear in the section of sky directly opposite the Sun.<br>

         Rainbows can be full circles.<br>
        The observer normally sees only an arc formed by illuminated droplets above the ground and centered on a line from the Sun to the observer's eye.<br>

         In a primary rainbow the arc shows red on the outer part and violet on the inner side. <br>
         This rainbow is caused by light being refracted when entering a droplet of water,<br>
         then reflected inside on the back of the droplet and refracted again when leaving it.<br>

         In a double rainbow second arc is seen outside the primary arc,<br>
          and has the order of its colours reversed with red on the inner side of the arc. <br>
          This is caused by the light being reflected twice on the inside of the droplet before leaving it </p>
